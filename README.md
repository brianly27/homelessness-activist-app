## Homelessness Activist App

### `Description
This app was inspired by two friends. One of whom had an idea for how to take actionable steps towards improving lives. He wanted to first find people who are ready to change their situation and then help them take the necessary steps to get the resources they might qualify for. This app addresses the latter.

Volunteers can potentially do the work that gets people off the street. This app will provide volunteers with step by step instructions for helping to file for resources such as identification, billing address, food stamps, health care, employment services.
